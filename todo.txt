- tab support
- make command window not an instance of a term
- buffer command input up to newline (glib)
- parse command input (glib)
- gutter between terms
	- borders fill gutter, collapsible
	- 

DONE

- something's screwy where top doesn't end and scroll up properly... think something is messed up with window heights
	- turned out to be that the tesi terminal had more lines than it should have ... the vt->border window meant i needed to do 1 more calculation
