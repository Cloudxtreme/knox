ROADMAP

General

- test-suite for examining escape sequences returned from applications
- app to generate escape sequences on command
- data structure and algorithms for storing terminal state and contents: colors, positions, etc
- console windowing toolkit
- console drawing toolkit
	- diagonal lines
	- shapes
	- colors
	- special markup to be used from outside the app? specify welcome screen with markup?
	- how does this interact with the windowing toolkit?
- string library

Features

- detachment, so can resume later from other term (fg bg)
- multiheaded?
- scrollable history
- copy and paste
- terminal hiding


Commands
	:new .input=file:~/vtIn
- arrangement schemes
	- auto-divide - displays all on screen, in a grid-like fashion
		- options to favor width or height. if want 6 terms:
			- width would do 2 per row
			- height would do 3 per row
	- manual - specify number per row/col
		- this would combine with the rotating through slots approach
	- fixed # on screen - only have 4 or five, with ability to cycle through. initially have 0-4 on screen, then press key and 1-5 show, moving up the slots
	- best-fit - incorporates someof auto-divide, with manually specified limits
		- max - max number on screen. if try to add new but limit is exceeded, prompts user
		- vMax - man number of VTs vertically
		- hMax - max number of VTs horizontally
	:pause 3 - pauses terminal 3. doesn't update screen though data arrives


Crazy Ideas

- certain terms can auto focus on event
- when input is sent to term, change border
- when term doesn't produce output after a while, change border or dim
- copy and paste
- remote user to ssh to machine, run a client app that binds to 1+ terms for shared viewing

Questions

- do windows have border by default?
	- is that up to Animation plugin?
	- user preferences?
	- both?
- window sizing/arrangement/placement handled by WP?
- how animator plug into that?
	- need access to events queue to run scripts



ULTIMATE GOAL

- full text-based environment
- applets (weather, clock)
- dockapps
- remote viewer to join and view/participate in remote session



/dev/ptc - only for AIX
/dev/ptmx - normal pty cloner

POSSIBLE WAYS TO DEAL WITH CPU HOGGING APPS
1. sleep for a second. catch a user input signal



RESEARCH

What we're really making is called a screen scraper: http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal/pc_emulation.html

tput can output terminal codes for initialization

check out mlterm, dtelnet, rxvt
