++ Introduction

Knox might be called any of the following:

* terminal multiplexer
* GNU screen on steroids
* multiple virtual-terminal emulator

It divides up your console/terminal screen, allowing you to run multiple text-based applications in one session. This means you can SSH once into another machine, run knox on that machine, and have more than one application on-screen at the same time. Check the screenshots for an example, especially /files/knox-06.png(this one).

Sound like something you could use? How would you use it? /feedback(Let me know)



++ Technical Details

Knox currently uses libiterm at its core for interpreting escape sequences. One day, when /project/Tesi(TESI) is mature, I'll switch to it. But for now iterm works and it enables me to focus on making Knox usable and useful.

I've got a bit of an informal scratchpad for notes going on in my /wiki/pmwiki.php/Terminals/Terminals(wiki).



++ Screenshots

These were taken from my windows machine while running Knox over Putty, for kicks and screenshot taking ease.

++ History

This was originally a friend's idea from around 2004. He and I brainstormed code structure, functionality and features. When he moved away I continued poking at it and doing research. Eventually I gained a better view of the project scope and began coding.
