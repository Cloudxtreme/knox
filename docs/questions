how can we check if bash is busy running an app? waitpid()?

changing title of xterm? vt100 escape?

ETERNAL QUESTIONS

does bash convert program output to vt100? or is the actual program?
	would be the app. bash is just a route-through

how is ncurses efficient? wouldn't it just keep a 2 dim array of lines and cols and flush to screen?
	no, proabably keeps back buffer of vt100 codes and ascii. that way it can tell term to move and only update where it needs to.

how can i make an application take up less processor while waiting for input? has to run some kind of loop to update the screen every second, but that takes up processor
